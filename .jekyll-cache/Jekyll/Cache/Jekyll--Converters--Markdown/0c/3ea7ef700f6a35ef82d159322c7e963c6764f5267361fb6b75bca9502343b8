<p>Here is a view of almost exactly the same side of Mars as viewed by the 
<a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo0322e/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
back in 2003. It is annotated to point out the names of the most prominent dark features.  Note that the south polar icecap is currently much smaller than it was in August 2003 – it melts away as the Martian southern summer progresses.</p>
