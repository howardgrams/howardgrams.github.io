I"ó<p>M1, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the spectacular supernova of 1054.</p>

<p>Chinese astronomers watching the sky on July 4, 1054, noted the appearance of a new or ‚Äúguest‚Äù star in the constellation of Taurus. The bright source was visible during the daytime for 23 days, shining six times as brightly as Venus. Those well-versed with the night sky would have been able to see it for 653 days ‚Äî almost two years ‚Äî with the naked eye. Other observations of the explosion were recorded by Japanese, Arabic, and Native American stargazers.</p>
