I"‡<p>The entire Veil Nebula complex is BIG - it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  It is also known as the Cygnus Loop.</p>

<p>The source supernova exploded some 5,000 to 8,000 years ago, and the remnants have since expanded to cover an area roughly 3 degrees in diameter (about 6 times the diameter, or 36 times the area, of the full moon).</p>

<p>My previous three posts were recent images of the three brightest parts of the complex.  Here I have mosaiced together five separate older images to show the individual parts in relation to each other.</p>
