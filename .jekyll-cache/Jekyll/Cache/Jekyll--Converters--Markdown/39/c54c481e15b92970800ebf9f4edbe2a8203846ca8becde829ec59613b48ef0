I"y<p>Now rapidly moving away from both the sun and the eaarth, Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) was only discovered a few months ago and turned out to be the brightest comet visible from the northern hemisphere in the past twenty years.  A week ago it was easily visible to the naked eye, but has dimmed greatly since then.</p>

<p>Finally we had a partially clear (although hazy) sky this past Sunday evening and I was able to take a few images before the comet set behind the trees to the northwest.</p>

<p>Since the comet was closest to the earth on July 23, it still is moving rapidly relative to the  background stars.   The first two images below show how much the comet appears to move in just 15 minutes.  Because of the rapid movement, it is not possible to take long exposures without blurring the comet image.</p>
