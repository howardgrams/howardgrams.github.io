I"Ì<p>I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff. I started exploring the sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my newspaper money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About two years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope â€“ this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy).</p>
