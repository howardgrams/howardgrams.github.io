I"s<p>The planet Mars was closer to earth on October 6 than it will be anytime in the next 15 years.<br />
So this week was my last best chance in this lifetime to get a close-up look.</p>

<p>Here is an image I took two weeks ago that shows one side of the planet:</p>

<p>But here’s an interesting fact – Mars rotates in 24 hours and 40 minutes, just slightly longer than the earth’s 24 hours.  This means that if you go out and look at Mars tonight, you will see the almost same side of the planet as you did yesterday at the same time of night.</p>

<p>Here is the view nearly two weeks later.  The extra 40 minutes per day has added up and now we see nearly the opposite side of the planet:</p>

<p>As it happens, this side of Mars is the most interesting to see through a small telescope since it includes the Syrtis Major feature – perhaps the easiest Martian feature to make out in a small telescope besides the white polar caps.</p>

<p>Here is a view of almost exactly the same side of Mars as viewed by the 
<a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo0322e/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
back in 2003. It is annotated to point out the names of the most prominent dark features.  Note that the south polar icecap is currently much smaller than it was in August 2003 – it melts away as the Martian southern summer progresses.</p>
