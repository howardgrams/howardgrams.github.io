I"Ö<p>I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff. I started exploring the night sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my paper route money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About two years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope ‚Äì this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy). EAA usually involves computers as well as optical equipment, and being very much a computer person, this is right down my alley.  I‚Äôm also an amateur radio operator (callsign K7JNX) and became re-enthused about that hobby 16 years ago when it became possible to marry my computer and my radio equipment together.</p>

<p>In Jaunary of this year I got a new 8-inch Celestron RASA scope and a better astro camera.  The new RASA is photographically very ‚Äúfast‚Äù (f/2) and I am AMAZED at what I can see and photograph compared to visually observing through my old f/10 SCT telescope.</p>

<p>I thought I would share some examples of what I see by setting up this blog.</p>

<p>EAA allows amateur astronomers to observe objects in less than ideal conditions, especially under badly light polluted skies, or even when a bright Moon is present. Deep-sky celestial objects which are unimpressive or all but invisible in an eyepiece from urban or suburban skies easily become visible, with considerable detail, and in full color. By some informal estimates, EAA with a relatively inexpensive camera has the same effect as tripling telescope aperture for a visual observer without the drawbacks of a large bulky telescope. EAA is also ideal for us older observers whose visual acuity is not what it used to be.</p>

<p>A mini computer to control the camera and the telescope rides on the telescope and it communicates with the observer‚Äôs main computer.  The observer sees a detailed image in real time on his computer screen and can watch the results while multiple exposures are taken and stacked together to produce a better image with less noise.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, I took all the images on this blog from my light-polluted backyard using a Celestron RASA 8-inch astrograph (telescope) and an iOptron AZ Mount Pro alt-azimuth mount. The camera is a ZWO ASI183MC controlled using a software program named Sharpcap. I processed the raw images using another program named Startools. The images I show on this blog are formed from multiple  short exposures (typically 3 seconds) stacked together to reach a total exposure of between 3 and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I should note that processing astronomical images to tease out as much subtle detail as possible is very much an art.  Having only been doing this for four or five months, I‚Äôm very much still in the ‚Äúneophyte‚Äù category.</p>
