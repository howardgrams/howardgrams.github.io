I"b<p>The large and extensive Veil Nebula deserves another look. Here we see another separate portion, the western part of the nebula.</p>

<p>The Western Veil, NGC 6960, is sometimes known as the “Witch’s Broom”. This section is centered behind the bright star 52 Cygni. The right half in this image looks like a sharp fang with a darker center. The left half divides into parallel ribbons.</p>

<p>The Veil Nebula is a cloud of heated and ionized gas.</p>

<p>The eastern and the western Veils are visible portions of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. The source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the Sun which exploded between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. The remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon.</p>
