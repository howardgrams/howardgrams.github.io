I"Ù<p>If youâ€™ve ever seen a picture of another galaxy, odds are that it was of this one, the Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31. At a distance of 2.54 million light years from us, it is closer and hence  appears larger than any other galaxy (apart from the two Magellanic Clouds in the southern hemisphere that are small satellites of our Milky Way). And it is on a collision course with us and will collide with our Milky Way in about four billion years.</p>

<p>The Andromeda Galaxy is the most distant object and the only spiral galaxy outside our Milky Way able to be seen with the naked eye as a fuzzy patch in a dark sky.</p>

<p>Andromeda is a fairly tightly-wound spiral galaxy that is seen about 23 degrees away from being edge-on. Because of this, it is difficult to study its spiral structure. You can see very noticable dark dust clouds interspersed among the spiral arms, especially to the lower right (the portion of the disk nearest to us) and near the top.  Andromeda (M31) also has two prominent satellite galaxies - M110 (the fuzzy patch in the lower right corner) and M32 (the smaller and more circular fuzzy patch at about the 8 oâ€™clock position and closer to the nucleus of M31).</p>

<p>(I took this image in late February when Andromeda was fairly low in the west.  I hope to obtain better results next summer or autumn when it will be placed high in the sky.)</p>
