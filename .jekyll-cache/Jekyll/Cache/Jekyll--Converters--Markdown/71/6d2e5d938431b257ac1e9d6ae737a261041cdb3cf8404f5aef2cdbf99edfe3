<p>The Heart Nebula, IC 1805 or Sharpless 2-190, lies about 7500 light years away from Earth.<br />
It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.</p>

<p>The Heart Nebula’s intense red output is driven by the radiation emanating from a small group of stars near the nebula’s center. This open cluster of stars, known as Collinder 26 or Melotte 15, contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction of our Sun’s mass.</p>

<p>The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. A separate portion of NGC 896 is cataloged as IC 1795. The other parts of the Heart Nebula are very faint and visible only in hotographs.</p>

<p>Nearby open star cluster NGC 1027 contains about 50 stars, many in four prominent mutually intersecting star chains.  It is not physically associated with the Heart Nebula – it lies in the foreground, about 3,000 light years away from us.</p>

<hr />

<p>Since the Heart Nebula is a large object, larger than the field of view of my telescope/camera combination, I had to take four separate images offset from each other and then combine them together into a mosaic. This is the reason for the irregular edges.</p>

<p>Today’s post is the beginning of a second year for this blog.  My <a href="../Orion-Nebula/index.html">first post</a> was on February 3 of last year.</p>
