I"Ë<p>The Dumbbell Nebula M27 (also known as Apple Core Nebula) is a typical planetary nebula about 1300 light-years from us. It was the first such object to be discovered â€“ by Charles Messier in 1764.</p>

<p>So-called planetary nebulae are the remains of stars similar to our Sun. When they reach the end of their life cycle, they expel their outer gaseous layers to form the nebula, which is then heated by the hot core of the central white dwarf. This will be the fate of our Sun in roughly five billion years.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Dumbbell consists of very rarified gas that has been ejected from the hot central star (visible on this photo). The gas atoms in the nebula are heated by the intense ultraviolet radiation from this star and emit strongly at specific visible colors.</p>

<p>The gas cloud of a planetary nebula keeps expanding until it dissipates into the surrounding space. Measurements of the size of the nebula over time suggest that it is about three to four thousand years.  In another ten thousand years it will have faded to invisibility.  Enjoy the Dumbbell while it lasts!</p>

<p>My recent posts featuring the <a href="../Trifid-Nebula/index.html">Trifid</a>, <a href="../Lagoon-Nebula/index.html">Lagoon</a>, and <a href="../The-Eagle-Nebula/index.html">Eagle</a> nebulae showed stars being born.  Planetary nebulae like the Dumbell and <a href="../M97-and-M108/index.html">Owl</a> represent star end of life situations â€“ exactly the opposite.</p>
