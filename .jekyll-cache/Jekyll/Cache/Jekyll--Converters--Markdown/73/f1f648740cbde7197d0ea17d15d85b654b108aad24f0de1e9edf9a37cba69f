I"ç<p>I finally got a good chance to take the telescope out the other day and got a good look at the somewhat whimsical Running Man Nebula.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Running Man Nebula</strong></em>  ¬†¬† (20 min total exposure Mar 3, 2021)<br />    (move mouse over image to show notes, mouse off image to remove notes)<br />

<p>The Running Man nebula comprises three separate nebulae, NGC 1973, NGC 1975, and NGC 1977 that are divided by darker nebulous regions. It also includes the open cluster NGC 1981. The brightest portion (NGC 1977) was discovered in 1786. The two smaller reflection nebulae were first noted in 1862 and 1864.  This whole region is just north of the great Orion Nebula that I previously shared <a href="../Orion-Nebula.html">here</a>.</p>
