I"©<p>The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters and Messier 45, are an open star cluster containing hot middle-aged stars in the constellation Taurus. It is among the star clusters nearest to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky. Most people can see the 6 or 7 brightest stars that form a smallish â€œdipperâ€ â€“ NOT to be confused with the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor constellation).</p>
