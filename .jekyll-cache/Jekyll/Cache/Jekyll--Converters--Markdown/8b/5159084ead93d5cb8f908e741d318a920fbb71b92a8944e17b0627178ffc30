I"|<p>M1, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the spectacular supernova of 1054.</p>

<p>Chinese astronomers watching the sky on July 4, 1054, noted the appearance of a new or “guest” star in the constellation of Taurus. The bright source was visible during the daytime for 23 days, shining six times as brightly as Venus. Those well-versed with the night sky would have been able to see it for 653 days — almost two years — with the naked eye. Other observations of the explosion were recorded by Japanese, Arabic, and Native American stargazers.</p>
