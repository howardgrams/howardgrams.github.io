I" <p>Since the images on this blog are relatively large and contain a lot of detail, I highly recommend that you view them in a browser on your computer screen – and not just on your phone.</p>

<p>If your browser window is relatively narrow, you may need to use the horizontal scroll bar to see the right portion of an image. For best results, maximize the browser window on your screen. Even better, most browsers have a “full screen” mode that you can get to by pressing the F11 key.  WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH FULL SCREEN MODE, PRESS F11 AGAIN TO RETURN TO NORMAL MODE.</p>

<p>If you are using a mobile device, images with notes should display the notes if you tap on the image instead of moving the mouse over as suggested. The notes go away if you tap somewhere other than on the image.</p>
