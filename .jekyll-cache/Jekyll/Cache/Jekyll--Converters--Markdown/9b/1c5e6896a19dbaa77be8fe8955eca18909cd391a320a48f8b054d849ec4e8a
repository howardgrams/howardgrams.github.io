I"ÿ<p>Hereâ€™s a fresh view of the Horsehead Nebula and Flame Nebula together, two near neighbors in the sky.</p>

<p>Last week we had a night with exceptionally clear and transparent skies. I was able to image a couple of new objects as well as take a fresh look at some old favorites. Among my old favorites are the Horsehead and Flame, as seen here.</p>

<p><em><strong>Horsehead Nebula and Flame Nebula</strong></em>  Â Â  (35 min total exposure Jan 27, 2022)<br />

to see my orignal post of the Horsehead, and

to see that original post.</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s image is a longer exposure that covers a larger area of the sky and shows how the two are really part of a much larger nebula complex. Plus, the sky conditions were better and Iâ€™ve learned a little more about taking and processing images in the meantime.</p>
