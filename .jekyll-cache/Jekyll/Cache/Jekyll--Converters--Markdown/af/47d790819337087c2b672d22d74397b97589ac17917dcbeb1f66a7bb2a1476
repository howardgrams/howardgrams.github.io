I"‚<p>I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff ‚Äì I started exploring the sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my newspaper money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About two years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope ‚Äì this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy).</p>

<p>In Jaunary of this year I acquired a new 8-inch RASA scope and a better astro camera.  The new RASA is photographically ‚Äúfast‚Äù (f/2) and I am amazed at what I can see and photograph using a modern CMOS camera compared to visually observing through my old f/10 telescope.</p>

<p>I thought I would share some examples of what I see by setting up this blog.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, all images on this blog were taken from my light-polluted backyard using a Celestron RASA 8 astrograph (telescope) and an iOptron AZ Mount Pro alt-azimuth mount. The camera is a ZWO ASI183MC controlled using the Sharpcap software program, and I processed the raw images using the Startools software program. The images I show on this blog are stacks of multiple  short exposures (typically 3 seconds) to reach a total exposure of between 3 and 15 minutes.</p>
