I"f<p>Since the images on this blog are relatively large and contain a lot of detail, I recommend that you view them on your computer screen instead of on your phone.</p>

<p>If your browser window is relatively narrow, you will need to use the horizontal scroll bar to see the right portion of an image. For best results, you should maximize the browser window on your screen. Even better, most browsers have a “full screen” mode that you can get to by pressing the F11 key.  WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH FULL SCREEN MODE, PRESS F11 AGAIN TO RETURN TO NORMAL MODE.</p>

<p>If you are using a phone or other mobile device, you WILL need to scroll images around to see the whole image.
Images with notes should display the notes if you tap on the image when the suggestion is to move the mouse over. The notes should go away if you tap somewhere other than on the image.</p>
