I"<p>The Christmas Tree Cluster was named for its triangular shape, formed by a cluster of very young stars,  that looks like a tree in visible light. The bright variable star S Monocerotis (near the bottom) marks the base of the Christmas tree and lights up the nearby nebulosity.</p>

<p>(This cluster was one of my favorite objects to look at with my first 4 1/2 inch telescope back in the mid 1950s.)</p>
