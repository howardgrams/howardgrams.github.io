I"=<p>I recently got a good chance to take the telescope out again the other day and got a good look at the somewhat whimsical space ghost - the Running Man Nebula.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Running Man Nebula</strong></em>     (20 min total exposure Mar 3, 2021)<br />    (move mouse over image to show notes, mouse off image to remove notes)<br />

<p>The Running Man seems to resemble the shape of a man sprinting, with his huge arms in motion.</p>

<p>The Running Man nebula comprises three separate nebulae, NGC 1973, NGC 1975, and NGC 1977 that are divided by darker nebulous regions. It also includes the open cluster NGC 1981. The brightest portion (NGC 1977) was discovered in 1786. The two smaller reflection nebulae were first noted in 1862 and 1864.  This whole region is just a half degree (i.e. the width of the moon) north of the great Orion Nebula that I previously shared <a href="../Orion-Nebula/index.html">here</a>.</p>
