I"A<p>Now rapidly moving away from both the sun and the earth, Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) was only discovered a few months ago and turned out to be the brightest comet visible from the northern hemisphere in the past twenty years.  A week ago it was easily visible to the naked eye, but it has dimmed greatly since then.</p>
