I"²<p>Brocchiâ€™s Cluster (also known as Collinder 399) is a random grouping of ten stars that form an asterism which has given rise to its name as the Coathanger.</p>

<p>The status of this group as a star cluster has changed in recent years. The group was considered to be a cluster for most of the 20th century. Looking at a variety of criteria, however, a study in 1970 concluded that only 6 of the brightest stars formed an actual cluster. Several independent studies since 1998 have now determined that this object is not a true cluster at all, but rather just a chance alignment of stars.</p>

<p>The coathanger was another of my favorite objects in my small telescope 65 years ago. Since the ten stars are between the fifth and seventh magnitudes, it can be seen very nicely through binoculars.</p>
