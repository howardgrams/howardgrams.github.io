I"B<p>Now rapidly moving away from both the sun and the earth, Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) was only discovered on March 27 and turned out to be the brightest comet visible from the northern hemisphere since Comet Haleâ€“Bopp in 1997. A week ago it was easily visible to the naked eye, but it has dimmed greatly since then.</p>
