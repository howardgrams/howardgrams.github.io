I"<p>I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff. I started exploring the night sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my paper route money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About two years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope â€“ this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy). EAA usually involves computers as well as optical equipment, and being very much a computer person, this is right down my alley.  Iâ€™m also an amateur radio operator (callsign K7JNX) and became re-enthused about that hobby 16 years ago when it became possible to marry my computer and my radio equipment together.</p>
