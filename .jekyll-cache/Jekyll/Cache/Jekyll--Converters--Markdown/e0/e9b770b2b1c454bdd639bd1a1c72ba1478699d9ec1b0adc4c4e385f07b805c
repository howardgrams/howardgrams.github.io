I"O<p>The entire Veil Nebula (also known as the Cygnus Loop) is BIG - it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  My previous three posts were recent images of the three brightest parts of the complex.  Here I have mosaicked together five separate older images so you can see the individual parts in relation to each other.</p>
