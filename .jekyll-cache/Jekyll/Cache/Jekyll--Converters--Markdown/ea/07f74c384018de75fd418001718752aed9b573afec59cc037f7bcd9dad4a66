I"|<p>The planet Mars was closer to earth on October 6 than it will be anytime in the next 15 years.  The closer it is, the larger it appears and the more detail can be seen. Close also means bright â€“ if you go out in the evening just after dark these days, you will see Mars as the really bright red object in the southeast, brighter and redder than any other star or planet,</p>
