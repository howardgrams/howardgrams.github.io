<p>(The Double Cluster was another of my favorite objects from sixty years ago - bright and easy to find with a small telescope - or even a good pair of binoculars.  In general, when viewed through the eyepiece of a small telescope, open clusters look similar to their photographs.  This is completely unlike galaxies, nebula, or even globular clusters, all of which tend to just look like smudges of light visually through a small telescope.)</p>
