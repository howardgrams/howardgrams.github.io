title: Globular Clusters
---

Here are four representative Globular clusters.   Globular Clusters are gigantic spherical agglomerations of stars that surround the nucleus of our Milky Way galaxy.  Each globular cluster from hundreds of thousands to several million stars, and astronomers believe that the stars is most globular clusters are among the oldest stars in existance, perhaps as much as 10 billion years old.


M3 has an exceptionally dense bright core

M4 is one of the sky's easiest globulars to resolve into individual stars. Some of the stars across the face of the cluster form a unique "star bar" bisecting the cluster from north to south.

Many of the cluster members of M5 form curious strings.

Finally, the Hercules Cluster M13 is generally considered to be finest globular cluster visible in the northern hemisphere

(The Omega Centauri globular cluster in the southern hemisphere is the biggest, nearest, brightest and best globular cluster.  Unfortunately, from my latitude it only peeks a maximum of 4 degrees above the horizon.  And from my backyard, trees obsure the far southern horizon and just barely keep me from seeing it.  I was able to catch glimpses of it obscured through the tree brances about three weeks ago.)
