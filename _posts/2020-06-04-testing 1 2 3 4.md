(The Double Cluster was another of my favorite objects from sixty years ago - bright and easy to find with a small telescope - or even a good pair of binoculars.

This is completely unlike galaxies, nebula, or even globular clusters, all of which tend to just look like smudges of light visually through a small telescope.)
