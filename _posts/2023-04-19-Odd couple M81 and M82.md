These two spectacular galaxies are neighbors, located near the bowl of the big dipper.
M82 is an irregular edge-on galaxy showing red gas and dark clouds. Its neighbor M81 is face-on, and displays stately grand spiral arms.

M82 (also known as the Cigar galaxy) and M81 (also known as Bode's galaxy) are about 12 million light years away from us. They are the largest members in a group of 34 galaxies.


 According to NASA, 
 > The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters. Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81's spiral arms. M82 was left with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays. In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain."

One of my very early blog posts three years ago was also a look at M82 and M81.
In those  days I was discovering what I could see with relatively short exposures, what is known as EAA (electronically assisted astronomy). More recently I have gradually transitioned into taking longer exposures  and developing more skill at processing them, what is properly described as astrophotography.
It's interesting to compare the earlier image with this one;
