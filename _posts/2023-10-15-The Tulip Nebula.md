The Tulip Nebula is a glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust and gets its name from the flower it appears to resemble in photographs. 
While a pretty sight itself, the Tulip has an interesting neighbor.

It was cataloged by American astronomer Stewart Sharpless in 1959 as Sharpless Sh2-101. 
The nebula is about 6000 light-years from Earth, and 70 light-years across
and glows as a result of powerful young stars ionising cosmic gas and causing it to emit light.

An interesting feature of the Tulip Nebula is its nearby neighbor (as seen from our vantage point on Earth), the galactic X-ray source known as Cygnus X-1.

Cygnus X-1 is one of the strongest X-ray sources in the sky as seen from Earth and in 1964 was determined to be the site of the first black hole ever discovered.
The system consists of a bright blue star HD 226868 (which we can easily see) and a high mass very small invisible object. The pair orbit around each other in under 6 days. Measurements show that the the compact object has a mass of 15 Suns and its diameter is only about 30 miles. That means it is a black hole.
The black hole pulls gas off the surface of the star and this gas forms a spiral (accretion disk) as it falls towards the center of the black hole. Friction heats the gas in an accretion disk to incredibly high temperatures, so hot that it emits X-rays.
Cygnus X-1 is about 7400 light years away from us, somewhat further than the Tulip Nebula.
