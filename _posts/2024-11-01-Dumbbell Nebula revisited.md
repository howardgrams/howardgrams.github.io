The Dumbbell Nebula, also known as M27, is a stunning cloud of gas and dust, located about 1,360 light-years away from Earth. One of the brightest and most beautiful nebulae in the night sky, it is especially known for its vibrant colors and distinctive shape, which resembles a dumbbell or an hourglass.

What makes M27 special is that it's a "planetary nebula," which is formed when a star similar to our Sun reaches the end of its life. Indeed, in 1764 it was the first such object to be discovered. When the star runs out of fuel, it sheds its outer layers, creating this glowing, colorful cloud. The bright colors come from the gases within the nebula, especially hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, each emitting light at different wavelengths. The bluish-green areas are rich in oxygen, while the red and pink areas indicate hydrogen and nitrogen.

At the center of the nebula is a small white dwarf, the hot, dense core of the original star that once existed here. This white dwarf emits intense ultraviolet light that makes the gases in the nebula glow brightly. 
The gas cloud of a planetary nebula keeps expanding until it dissipates into the surrounding space. Measurements of the size of the nebula over time suggest that it is about three to four thousand years old. In another ten thousand years it will have faded to invisibility. Enjoy the Dumbbell while it lasts!
