The lesser-known Cat's Paw Nebula (officially NGC 6334) is a region teeming with activity -- 
another stellar nursery where stars are born from swirling contracting clouds of gas and dust.
  
<!--endSummary-->
The nebula’s distinct shape, reminiscent of a feline paw print, has earned it its charming nickname.

This remarkable nebula lies about 5,500 light-years from Earth and is about 50 light-years across.
The vibrant reddish-orange glow is produced by ionized hydrogen gas, which is energized by ultraviolet light from hot, 
young stars forming deep within the nebula. The darker patches you see are areas where thick dust clouds obscure the light, 
adding depth and mystery to the scene. 


One thing that makes the Cat’s Paw Nebula so fascinating is that it represents just one small piece of the Milky Way’s larger story. The newly born stars within the nebula will some day probably
host their own planetary systems.
