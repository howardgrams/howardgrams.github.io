Near the bright star Sadr (grossly over exposed in the image) at the center of the Northern Cross lies the Butterfly Nebula. Its nickname comes from its intricate shape that somewhat resembles a butterfly with its delicate wings outstretched.

The Butterfly is officially cataloged as IC 1318. 
Note some of the subtle yet intricate details. 

- This beautiful structure is an emission nebula, primarily made up of hydrogen gas. 

- The nebula’s "wings" are illuminated by the energy of light emitted by young, hot nearby embedded stars. When that starlight
hits this gas, it excites the hydrogen atoms, causing them to emit light. This process is what gives emission nebulae like IC 1318 their characteristic reddish glow. 

- Unlike many nebulae, the Butterfly Nebula doesn’t have a single dominant star at its core; instead, it represents a tapestry of stellar activity spread across several light-years.

- The dark regions that carve out the butterfly's "wings" are areas of dense interstellar dust. These dust clouds are so thick that they block the light from the stars behind them, creating stark, shadowy contrasts against the bright nebulous backdrop. These shadows add to the beauty and complexity of the nebula.

- The Butterfly Nebula is part of a larger star-forming region in the Milky Way, a veritable nursery where new stars are born. The dark bands that crisscross the nebula are not gaps but dense clouds of interstellar dust that block the light behind them, creating a dramatic contrast against the glowing hydrogen gas. These dark lanes are a stark reminder of the complex interplay between light and shadow in the universe.

- What’s fascinating about IC 1318 is its scale and context. It lies about 5,000 light-years from Earth, stretching across an area larger than the full moon in the night sky. Yet its beauty is faint, requiring long exposures to reveal the intricate details hidden in the cosmic haze.  The bright star Sadr (over exposed in the image) is not related to the nebula - it is much closer to us, only about 1500 light years away.

- Notice open star cluster NGC 6910 near the upper right corner of the image.  It may be associated with the nebula since it lies at a similar distance from us.
