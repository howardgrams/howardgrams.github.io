I am a retired computer programmer in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff.

### More Information

Unless otherwise mentioned, all images on this blog were taken from my backyard using a Celestron RASA 8 astrograph (telescope) and a ZWO ASI183MC camera, and were processed using the Startools software program.
