I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff -- I started exploring the sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up to get a 4 1/2 inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About two years ago I acquired an astro camera and started using it with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope, dabbling around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy).

In Jaunary of this year I acquired a new 8-inch RASA scope and a better camera.  The new RASA is photographically "fast" (f/2) and I am amazed at what I can see and photograph using a modern CMOS camera compared to visually observing through my old f/10 telescope.

I thought I would share some examples of what I see by setting up this blog.

### More Information

Unless otherwise mentioned, all images on this blog were taken from my light-polluted backyard using a Celestron RASA 8 astrograph (telescope) and an iOptron AZ Mount Pro alt-azimuth mount. The camera is a ZWO ASI183MC controlled the Sharpcap software program, and I processed the raw images using the Startools software program.
