Since the images on this blog are relatively large and contain a lot of detail, I highly recommend that you view them in a browser on your computer screen -- and not just on your phone.

For best results, maximize the browser window on your screen. Even better, most browsers have a "full screen" mode that you can get to by pressing the F11 key.  WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH FULL SCREEN MODE, PRESS F11 AGAIN TO RETURN TO NORMAL MODE.
